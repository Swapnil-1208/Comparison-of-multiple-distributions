# Comparison of multiple distributions

The data set Height_Data.csv contains the heights of the players of six German menâ€™s national teams: basketball, handball, ice hockey, soccer, volleyball, and water polo. For each player of each team, the height (measured in centimeters) is given.

#Tasks:
  1. Do the heights of the players differ between the six sports? Conduct a global test.
  2. Are there pairwise differences between the heights of the players? Consider all pairs of sports and conduct two-sample tests. Adjust the test results with the Bonferroni method in order to address the multiple testing problem. Interpret the results. Compare the results with and without adjusting for multiple testing. For both tasks, remember to check that all assumptions hold before applying the respective tests.
